All communications within this program is done via the python scripts and the txt files. 

REQUESTING data from microservice A <br>
To request data you should call the function CreateA() which is the function that creates a new user, or you should call the checkUser() when using the login feature to see if the user has given a correct match for username and password. All of the data is given and gotten from the two text files

RECEIVING data from microservice A <br>
Using the text file info.text you can get user information if they have given a correct input. You match the username to the username stored in the text file and it will return the needed data stored after the hyphen.
