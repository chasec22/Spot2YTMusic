# Spot2YTMusic

All communications within this program is done via the python scripts and the txt files. 

In order to run this script for yourself you will need to setup an account with both the Google Youtube API and Spotify API, But if you wish to test this without setting all the scenarios up, feel free to reach to get the client_secrets.json and .env file.

Thank you!
